    # Convert date strings to datetime objects
    today = datetime.strptime(todays_date, '%dth %B')
    scheduled = datetime.strptime(scheduled_date, '%dth %B')

    # Compare the dates
    if today > scheduled:

    elif today == scheduled:
        print("The scheduled date is today.")
    else:
        print("The scheduled date is yet to pass.")

# Example Test Cases
date_passed('26th March', '25th March')   # Output: The scheduled date has passed.
date_passed('26th March', '26th March')   # Output: The scheduled date is today.
date_passed('26th March', '27th March')   # Output: The scheduled date is yet to pass.

    # Your code goes here
    # Implement the logic to compare the dates and print the appropriate message
